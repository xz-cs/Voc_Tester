This is a vocabulary tester program built with Python3 (IDLE)<br>

You can set the words and their Chinese translations that you are trying to remember in "source.txt"<br>

!!!IMPORTANT!!!<br>
# The format :<br>
{English}:{Chinese Translation}<br>
{English}:{Chinese Translation}<br>

# If there are more than one possible Chinese Translations, devide them by a '/':<br>
{English}:{Chinese Translation1}/{Chinese Translation2}<br>
{English}:{Chinese Translation1}/{Chinese Translation2}/{Chinese Translation3}/.../{Chinese Translation n}<br>

# Example:<br>
physics:物理<br>
welfare:福祉/福利<br>
binoculars:望远镜/双筒望远镜<br>

# Pay attention:<br>
The ":" is an English punctuation!

"source.text" should be in pure text mode, and you should not modify its name.




When you have set the words, just compile and run the "main.py" file with a python3 compiler!

There are two modes. Some special rules will be clarified in the program.
