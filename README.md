This is a vocabulary tester program built with Python3 (IDLE)

You can set the words and their Chinese translations that you are trying to remember in "source.txt"

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
# The format :
{English}:{Chinese Translation}
{English}:{Chinese Translation}

# If there is more than one possible Chinese Translation, devide them by a '/':
{English}:{Chinese Translation1}/{Chinese Translation2}
{English}:{Chinese Translation1}/{Chinese Translation2}/{Chinese Translation3}/.../{Chinese Translation n}

# Example:
physics:物理
welfare:福祉/福利
binoculars:望远镜/双筒望远镜

# Pay attention:
The ":" is an English punctuation!
"source.text" should be in pure text mode, and you should not modify its name.
